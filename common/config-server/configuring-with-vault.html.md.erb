## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) is a secrets management tool, which encrypts and stores credentials, API keys, and other secrets for use in distributed systems. It provides support for access control lists, secret revocation, auditing, and leases and renewals, and includes special capabilities for common infrastructure and systems such as AWS, MySQL, and RabbitMQ, among others. For more information about Vault, see the [documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/index.html).

Spring Cloud Config provides a Vault backend so that the Spring Cloud Config Server can serve configuration stored in Vault. The Spring Cloud Services Config Server supports this backend and can serve configuration stored in Vault to client applications which have been given access to the Vault server (this includes provision of a Vault access token for the client application).

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: Spring Cloud Services does not provide a HashiCorp Vault server. You must provide your own Vault server in order to use Config Server with Vault.</p>

See below for information about configuring a Config Server service instance to use a HashiCorp Vault server for a configuration source.

## <a id="general-configuration"></a>General Configuration

Parameters used to configure a configuration source are part of a JSON object called `vault`, as in `{"vault": { "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "8200" } }`.

<p class='note'><strong>Important</strong>: The Spring Cloud Services Config Server supports only one Vault backend, so only one <code>vault</code> object is permitted in the configuration parameters.</p>

General parameters used to configure a Config Server configuration source are listed below.

| Parameter                     | Function                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <code>host</code>             | The host of the Vault server                                                                 |
| <code>port</code>             | The port of the Vault server                                                                 |
| <code>scheme</code>           | The URI scheme used in accessing the Vault server (default value: `http`)                    |
| <code>backend</code>          | The name of the Vault backend from which to retrieve configuration (default value: `secret`) |
| <code>defaultKey</code>       | The default key from which to retrieve configuration (default value: `application`)          |
| <code>profileSeparator</code> | The value used to separate profiles (default value: `,`)                                     |

The value of `defaultKey` is masked in the Config Server dashboard.

For information about writing a client application that accesses configuration values from a Config Server which has been configured to use Vault, see the [Use a HashiCorp Vault Server](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/writing-client-applications.html#use-a-hashicorp-vault-server) section of the [Writing Client Applications](/spring-cloud-services/config-server/writing-client-applications.html) topic.

## <a id="proxy-repository-access"></a>HTTP(S) Proxy Repository Access

You can configure a Config Server service instance to access a configuration source using an HTTP or HTTPS proxy. To do so, you must provide proxy settings in either of the `vault.proxy.http` or `vault.proxy.https` JSON objects. You can set the proxy host and port, the proxy username and password (if applicable), and a list of hosts which the Config Server should access outside of the proxy.

Settings for an HTTP proxy are set in the `vault.proxy.http` object. These might be set as shown in the following JSON:

```
'{"vault": { "proxy": { "http": { "host": "proxy.wise.com", "port": "80" } } } }'
```

Settings for an HTTPS proxy are set in the `vault.proxy.https` object. These might be set as shown in the following JSON:

```
'{"vault": { "proxy": { "https": { "host": "secure.wise.com", "port": "443" } } } }'
```

The parameters used to configure HTTP or HTTPS proxy settings for the Config Server are listed below.

| Parameter                                  | Function                                                                                                                                            |

To configure a Config Server service instance that uses an HTTP proxy to access a configuration source, use the following JSON object:

```
'{"vault": { "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "8200", "proxy": { "http": { "host": "proxy.wise.com", "port": "80" } } } }'
```

To configure a Config Server service instance that uses an authenticated HTTPS proxy to access a configuration source, specifying that `example.com` should be accessed outside of the proxy, use the following JSON object:

```
'{"vault": { "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": "8200", "proxy": { "https": { "host": "secure.wise.com", "port": "443", "username": "jim", "password": "wright62", "nonProxyHosts": "example.com" } } } }'
```

### Multiple proxy servers

Some networks require that seperate proxy servers are used for HTTP and HTTPS URLs. This is supported in Config Server by setting both <code>proxy.http</code> and <code>proxy.https</code> objects.
